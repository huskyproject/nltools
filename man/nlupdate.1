.TH NLUPD 1 "nltools" "18 April 2012" "Husky - Portable Fidonet Software"
.SH NAME
nlupd \- Manages your Nodelists and keeps them up to date.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nlupd [-hvq] [-c configfile]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B nlupd
are main utility in the nltools package. It
manages your nodelists and keeps them up to date. For each
nodelist that you have configured with a "Nodelist" statement,
it will search the latest nodelist in the "NodelistDir", then
calculate the day number of the difference file that is needed to
update this nodelist, then search the difference file, unpack
it if necessary, and apply it to the nodelist using
.B nldiff
utility.
.B nlupd
can also find full
replacement files if you configure this, and just unpack them and copy
them over the old nodelist. This is useful for othernets that do not have
nodediff files. With only a few keywords, nlupd manages the whole
process of updating your nodelist files for you.
.B nlupd
can also process
daily nodelists files if you configure this with the Dailynodelist statement.

The following lines show a nlupd-related part of sample configuration file.
If you are only interested in the nodelist tools, you can just copy those
commands into a text file, modify them according to your needs (OS/2, Win and
DOS users may of course use backslashes instead of forward slashes, and drive
letters), and point the FIDOCONFIG variable to this file. Don't forget to run
.B tparser
